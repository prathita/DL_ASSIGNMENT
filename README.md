# L1 and L2 Regularization with Linear Regression model
An implementation of L1 and L2 Normalization with linear regression in numpy.

## Introduction
Using the [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) dataset from Kaggle, our goal is to implement L1 and L2 Normalization to regularize a linear model, and make a comparison between the performance of L1 and L2. Through this implementation, we get to examine the three ways vectors are used in machine learning - to represent input data, represent our model weights and regularize our model. Finally, we get to predict the impact of global warming on average temperatures in Los Angeles!

## Requirements
* python3
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Usage
Run `jupyter notebook` in your Python 3 environment
